## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-monitoring/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/hydro-monitoring/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected and actual behavior.

### Fixing bugs

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


### New Features

* Suggest your change via [![Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/Slack-4A154B?style=for-the-badge&logo=slack&logoColor=white)](https://hydrospheredata.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-tt4j24xj-TpnI_D2aJDBHIbA~EmPSlQ#/shared-invite/email) and start writing code.
