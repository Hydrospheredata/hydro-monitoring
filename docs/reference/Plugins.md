# Plugins
A plugin is a service that uses GRPC API to communicate with manager service, and can provide itâ€™s own web UI.
A plugin is a web service that MUST use  [GRPC API for plugin management](https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/monitoring-manager/blob/master/src/main/protobuf/monitoring_manager.proto) 
Plugins can expose their own web UI as a module that will be attached to our UI. The HTTP requests sent from the web UI are to be proxied by manager.

1. (Optional) Internal initialization of a plugin.

5. (Optional) Process training data of models.
6. Call DataStorageService.GetInferenceDataUpdates to get endless stream of inference files of a model.
7. (Optional) Process inference data of models.
